# Authentication-and-Cryptographic-Security-Controls

## 📌 Project Overview

The Authentication-and-Cryptographic-Security-Controls project demonstrates how modern systems secure user identity, protect sensitive data, and maintain session integrity through layered security mechanisms. This project explores the integration of password policies, cryptographic encryption (AES), secure hashing (SHA-256), multi-factor authentication (MFA), session token management, and Linux process enumeration within a cohesive cybersecurity architecture.

The objective is to illustrate how these controls work together to implement a defense-in-depth strategy.


## 🏗️ Architecture Components

This project covers the following core security controls:

**1️⃣ Password Policy Enforcement**

- Minimum length and complexity requirements

- Prevention of weak credential usage

- Foundation for authentication security

**2️⃣ Secure Hashing (SHA-256)**

- Protection of stored credentials

- One-way hashing to prevent password recovery

- Mitigation of database breach impact

**3️⃣ Cryptographic Encryption (AES)**

- Data confidentiality at rest and in transit

- Protection of sensitive information

- Secure key-based symmetric encryption

**4️⃣ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- Additional identity verification layer

- Reduces risk of credential compromise

- Protects against phishing and password reuse attacks

**5️⃣ Session Token Management**

- Maintains authenticated user sessions

- Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

- Prevention of session hijacking and replay attacks

**6️⃣ Windows Process Enumeration**

- CMD-based visibility into running processes

- Detection of suspicious activity

- Strengthening host-level security monitoring


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Demonstrate layered authentication controls

- Explain cryptographic protection mechanisms

- Highlight common weaknesses in session management

- Bridge theoretical security principles with practical implementation

- Reinforce defensive thinking from a SOC perspective


## 🔍 Security Perspective

This project emphasizes that authentication security is not achieved through a single control. Strong passwords alone are insufficient without secure hashing. Encryption without proper key management is ineffective. Session tokens without expiration controls introduce risk. True security emerges from the coordinated integration of multiple mechanisms.

The architecture reflects real-world cybersecurity best practices by combining preventive, protective, and detective controls.


## 🛡️ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, we gained a deeper understanding of:

- How authentication workflows operate

- How cryptographic algorithms protect data

- How session-based authentication can be exploited if misconfigured

- How system-level process monitoring supports threat detection

- Why defense-in-depth is critical in modern environments


## 📚 Conclusion

The Authentication-and-Cryptographic-Security-Controls project demonstrates how layered authentication mechanisms, cryptographic safeguards, and system monitoring collectively reduce the attack surface. By integrating identity verification, encryption, hashing, and session security, the architecture showcases a comprehensive approach to protecting modern digital systems.
